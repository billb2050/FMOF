# FMOF

I wrote this program because the *Famous Monsters Of Filmland* (FMOF) PDFs are just images. There is no text to select or search on. So...

Each PDF is an issue.
This program extracts all images from the FMOF PDFs into a directory, one image per page, using the Linux command line program *pdfimages*.  
 It then extracts the text from those images using the Linux OCR command line program *tesseract*.  

It would be very tedious to do this manually.
